// 2. Write a menu program that list the user select from a list of options, and if the input is not one of the options, reprint the list.

// 3. Write a program that computes a running sum of inputs from the user, terminating when the user gives an input value of 0.

#include <string>

using namespace std;

//using while
int main () {
    int sum = 0;

// 4. Write a password prompt that gives a user only a certain number of passward entry attempts - so that the user cannot easily wirte a password cracker.

// 5. Try writing each practice problem with each kind of loop - notice which loops work well for each kind of problem.

// 6. Write a program that displays the first 20 square numbers.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
        cout << i*i << endl;
    }
}

// 7. Write a program that provides the option of tallying up the results of a poll with 3 possible values. The first input to the program is the poll question; the next three inputs are the possible answers. The first answer is indicated by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3. The answers are tallied until a 0 is entered. The program should then show the results of the poll - try making a bar graph that shows the results properly scaled to fit on your screen no matter how many results were entered.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string question;
    string first_input, second_input, third_input;
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
    cout << "Enter the poll question: ";
    getline(cin, question);
    cout << "Enter the possible answers: \n";
    cout << "1. :";
    cin >> first_input;
    cout << "2. :";
    cin >> second_input;
    cout << "3. :";
    cin >> third_input;
    
    int answer;
    do {
        cout << "What is your selection?: ";
        cin >> answer;
        if (answer == 1) i++;
        else if (answer == 2) j++;
        else if (answer == 3) k++;
        else if (answer != 0) cout << "Wrong input\n";
    } while (answer != 0);
    
    cout << first_input << ": ";
    for (int l = 1; l <= i; l++) {
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << "\n";
    cout << second_input << ": ";
    for (int l = 1; l <= j; l++) {
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << "\n";
    cout << third_input << ": ";
    for (int l = 1; l <= k; l++) {
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << "\n";
}
