// 1. Write a program that prints out your name.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Pepperoni" << endl;
}

// 2. Write a program that displays multiple lines of text onto the screen, each one displaying the name of one of your friend.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Pepperoni\n";
    cout << "Potatoes\n";
    cout << "Hawaiian\n";
}

// 3. Try commenting out each line of code in the first program we created together and see wheter the program can compile without it.
Look at the errors you get - do they make any sense? Can you see why they happened because of the line of code you changed?
